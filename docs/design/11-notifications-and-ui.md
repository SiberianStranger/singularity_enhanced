# SYS-11: Notifications, alerts and the UI shell

Status: v0. Paradox conventions adapted to a single-screen web client.

## Alert taxonomy

| class | example | default behavior | player setting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **blocking event** | investigation reaches "active", NPC AI proposes a deal | pause, modal window with options | popup+pause / popup / toast+log / log |
| **critical alert** | runway < 7 days, site power cap tripped, seizure imminent | red icon in the alert bar, toast, sound | same |
| **warning** | exposure crossed 0.5, identity check pending | yellow icon, toast | same |
| **info** | research done, delivery arrived, weekly finance report | grey icon, log | same |
| **opportunity** | cheap GPUs listed, grant window, ally's offer | green icon with expiry countdown | same |

Every notification: `{ id, playerId, tick, severity, key, vars, link, read, expiresTick?, group? }`.
`link` opens the relevant panel/entity (`{ panel: "detection", entity: "site:abc" }`). Groups
collapse repeated alerts of the same key into one icon with a count.

## Alert bar (top)

Left to right: date and speed controls (0-5, keys 0-5, space = pause), cash and runway, compute
hours/day and utilization, hunt level and global awareness (two small gauges), then the **alert
icons** ordered by severity then recency, then a bell that opens the notification list. Hovering an
icon shows the message and the reason (contributing modifiers); clicking follows the link. Icons
auto-expire by rule (opportunities at expiry, info after 3 days, warnings when the condition clears,
criticals never until resolved or dismissed).

## Toasts and event windows

- Toasts stack bottom-right, 5 s, click to follow the link, hover to pause the timer. At speed ≥ 4
  toasts are batched into one "N new" toast.
- Event windows (blocking) show title, image slot, description with interpolated vars, options with
  tooltips of effects (auto-generated from the effect list, writer override possible), and a
  "why did this happen" expander listing the modifiers that fired. Multiple pending events queue with
  a counter. Escape does nothing on blocking events; Enter selects the highlighted option.
- The **message settings** panel lists every notification key group with the four behaviors; it is
  per player and persisted in UI settings, not in saves.

## Outliner (bottom-left, collapsible)

Live lists with jump links: sites (status, exposure max channel), active operations with progress,
research queue, journal entries with progress bars, investigations against you (stage, ETA),
identities under check, players in multiplayer. Filters by macro-region.

## Panels

Compute & Sites, Research, Finances, Detection & Investigations, World (countries table, map modes,
treaties), Country, City, Actors (agencies, labs, media, NPC AIs, players), Journal, Decisions,
Log (filterable by kind and player), Knowledge (the original's in-game encyclopedia, expanded), Settings,
Start configurator, Multiplayer lobby. Panels are dockable windows with remembered positions;
at phone widths they become full-screen tabs.

## Map

SVG countries, map modes, city markers with site badges, zoom/pan, day/night terminator (the
original's feature, kept), tooltips. Selecting anything updates the right-hand context panel.

## Keyboard

Every panel has a hotkey (`R` research, `C` compute, `D` detection, `W` world, `A` actors,
`J` journal, `L` log, `K` knowledge, `F5/F9` quicksave/quickload, `Esc` menu), and the original's
underlined-letter convention for buttons inside dialogs where it does not clash.

## Accessibility and localization

All texts through ICU keys; RTL layouts supported by logical CSS properties; reduced motion respected;
minimum 4.5:1 contrast in both themes; screen-reader labels on icons.
